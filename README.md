# Auto-trader
Project Overview:
Auto-Trader is a simple yet efficient C++ application designed to manage vehicle sales and ownership records. The system automates key aspects of the sales process, including generating contracts and receipts, while also maintaining a customer-centric ownership tracking feature.

Key Features:

Vehicle Sales Management:

Allows users (sales staff) to record new vehicle sales into the system.

Each vehicle entry includes details like make, model, year, VIN, and price.

Automatic Contract & Receipt Generation:

When a vehicle is sold, the system automatically generates a sales contract detailing the purchase agreement.

Simultaneously, a receipt is generated for the customer, summarizing the transaction.

Customer Ownership Tracking:

Customers can retrieve a list of all vehicles they currently own.

Access is based on the customerâ€™s social security number (or national ID), ensuring secure and accurate ownership records.

Data Storage:

Sales, customer, and vehicle information are stored within the system.

Supports easy retrieval and reporting of ownership and sales history.
